            Manul Manufactory is a small company focussed on Manul soft toys. We are obsessed with these fluffy animals and want to spread our joy with you. That’s why we created a little configurator, where everyone can create his or her custom Manul. <br>But what actually is a Manul?</p>

        <p class="textblock">A Manul (Otocolobus Manul) or Pallas’s Cat is a small wild cat located in central asia. The cat hangs out in rocky crevices and dens at elevations as high as 15,000 feet. Its long fur makes it look stout and plush but also lets it appear much bigger than it actually is. The ears are set very low and wide apart, which circumstance led to the naming Otocolobus (means something like: ugly-eared). </p>
